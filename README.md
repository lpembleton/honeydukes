## Functions

At the moment this package contains the following functions:

* `envobj` which prints a ANSI coloured table listing all objcets in the current environment and their details, such as object type and dimensions. Useful for when working outside RStudion on a remote server via a terminal
* `corner` prints the top left corner of a user define matrix or data frame. This is very hand in bioinformatics when you are back and forth checking the general contents of a genotype matrix.

This package currently imports functions from [emphatic](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/emphatic) package by [coolbutuseless](https://github.com/coolbutuseless) for the ANSI colour highlighting.
